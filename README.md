###### Two Week Independent Project Intializied on April 16th, 2019.

#### By Jasmine Lee 
----------

## Description
A web application built in React that allows a user to view blogs about animals or view the quick facts page about animals. It also allows users to create a blog or fact about an animal. In the future, users will also be able to vote for their favorite facts and blogs with the option to sign in and give feedback to blogs.

## Difference Between Angular and React
Angular is a two-way data binding framework that updates the Real DOM, while React is a one-way property binding JavaScript library that updates the Virtual DOM.
